\section{Summary}
%1/2 Page
The paper discusses the testing challenges of autonomous vehicles in unstructured and human shared environments because of their low performance and mission achievement issues. 
%
Despite compute-intensive task, simulation-based testing is still in use as an alternative to the aforementioned approach when it explores different numbers of situations, and controls input and output analysis.
%
And thus, the authors proposed a testing framework based on MORSE (Modular Open Robots Simulation Engine) to provide a new testing environments to stress the navigation service.
%

The approach consists of a robotic simulator named $Mana$ and virtual worlds generated by the Procedural Content Generation (PCG) algorithm. 
%
The researchers collected relevant environmental attributes and robotic characteristics to build a world model for a simulation environment.
%
Regarding data collection and analysis, researchers gathered the navigation tracking's data and data sources come from the point of view of the robot and the external observer respectively.
%
Each simulation run is sorted as a binomial classification task depending on the successful and failed state of the test.
%
To evaluate the practical effectiveness, researchers validated the research by addressing three research questions.
%
The first question debates an influence that control parameters have on the levels of difficulty (easy, challenging, and very difficult configuration).
%
The next question examines which control parameters impact the level of indeterminism while the final is to compare the evolution of the fault navigation service among different levels of difficulties.
%
As a result, there is an obvious correlation between the control parameters and levels of difficulty when the deformation $d$ increases, it indicates the general trend of the rising of difficult level.
%
Because of many small obstacles, a large number of obstacles, and the bigger number of subdivisions of the ground surface, the level of difficulty also notices an increase.
%
Furthermore, researchers argue that any control parameters can affect to the evolution of diverse trajectories, not only the difficulty level as expected.
%
And finally, both the challenging and very difficult configuration reflect a higher revealing power than the easy configuration with respect to a faulty version of the navigation.



\section{Critical Discussion}
%1/2 Page
First of all, the paper was well written. In the beginning, it not only identified problems that the traditional testing framework faced in unstructured and human shared environments but also proposed an alternative solution to address those problems transparently.
%
Furthermore, researchers attempted to make their paper approachable to the public by explaining basic concepts such as measurements to classify the difficulty, macroscopic parameters for map generation, class of experiment, etc. in detail. Therefore, it makes those terms comprehensible, even for people with minimal software testing experience.  
%
Finally, the goals of the experiment are identified and measured by the authors when the paper provided compelling evidence with statistical figures to support their arguments in most of the given case studies.
%

On the other hand, the proposed approach missed its applicable usage to assert the practical effectiveness. 
%
Due to lack of the examples applied state-of-the-art approaches, it might be easy to introduce bias into its effectiveness and feasibility for testing robot navigation.
%
Another point is the reproducibility problem due to the absence of controlling parameters' information such as the number of obstacles, the obstacle size, and the number of subdivisions.
%
In order to address this problem, the authors might consider the settings suggested by the guide provided by other similar papers or they can add the default settings to their paper.
%
Regarding conclusion validity threats, the authors failed to mention some evaluation metrics such as Mann-Whitney U-test $p$-values to measure and evaluate final results, so that their conclusion could be less reliable and adequate to justify the hypothesis.
%
Besides, the configuration setting is limited in identifying which factor that affects to indeterminism, so that a given explanation to the second research question might be insufficient.
%
Therefore, this paper might be deficient to provide new insights toward the indeterminism and its evolution of the navigation in different levels of difficulties.
%
Last but not least, the experiment settings have restricted the world model to static elements due to their simplification. 
%
However, it will be better if the authors can solve the problem with dynamic elements in future work since these kinds of testing are quite popular and attract interest from the testing community.
%
To conclude, Iâ€™m interested in the idea of controlling the level of difficulty is by far an ideal, pragmatic approach for generating effective critical test cases to expose problems of the self-driving car but the proposed approach might be insufficient to translate this concept into applicable use.

\section{Rating}
% Add here the overall rating of the paper (1 start is BAD, 5 starts is VERY GOOD). Please explain in one or two sentences the reason of your evaluation and whether you suggests the paper for the next edition of the seminar.
\Stars{3}

The paper has defined concepts and experimental design transparently. However, there are still significant problems as mentioned above, so I would rate this paper 3 stars.

Of course, I do not recommend this paper for the next semester!
