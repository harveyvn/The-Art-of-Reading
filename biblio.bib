@article{loiacono_automatic_2011,
	Abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the application of evolutionary computation to the automatic generation of tracks for high-end racing games. The idea underlying our approach is that diversity is a major source of challenge/interest for racing tracks and, eventually, might play a key role in contributing to the player's fun. In particular, we focus on the diversity of a track in terms of its shape (i.e., the number and the assortment of turns and straights it contains), and in terms of driving experience it provides (i.e., the range of speeds achievable while driving on the track). We define two fitness functions that capture our idea of diversity as the entropy of the track's curvature and speed profiles. We apply both a single-objective and a multiobjective real-coded genetic algorithm (GA) to evolve tracks involving both a wide variety of turns and straights and also a large range of driving speeds. The results we report show that both single-objective and multiobjective approaches can successfully evolve tracks with a high degree of diversity both in terms of shape and achievable speeds.},

@article{xu_end--end_2016,
	Abstract = {Robust perception-action models should be learned from training data with diverse visual appearances and realistic behaviors, yet current approaches to deep visuomotor policy learning have been generally limited to in-situ models learned from a single vehicle or a simulation environment. We advocate learning a generic vehicle motion model from large scale crowd-sourced video data, and develop an end-to-end trainable architecture for learning to predict a distribution over future vehicle egomotion from instantaneous monocular camera observations and previous vehicle state. Our model incorporates a novel FCN-LSTM architecture, which can be learned from large-scale crowd-sourced vehicle action data, and leverages available scene segmentation side tasks to improve performance under a privileged learning paradigm.},
