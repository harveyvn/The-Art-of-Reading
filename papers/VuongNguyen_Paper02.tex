\section{Summary}
%1/2 Page
The paper discusses the testing challenges of autonomous vehicles in real-life situations since  such testing settings are ineffective and dangerous. 
%
Despite being computer-intensive, virtual environments are still in use as an alternative to the aforementioned approach. And thus, the authors proposed a search-based procedural content generation approach along with its AsFAULT prototype to address these problems. 
%
The paper introduces the Procedural Content Generation (PCG) as an algorithm to generate roads automatically and the Search-based Testing (SBST) as an algorithm to generate effective test cases in self-driving car contexts.
% 
By combining two algorithms, this approach will be able to produce efiicient test cases for exposing problems of self-driving car software systems.

Although AsFAULT’s road generation based on PCG is challenging due to complexities in geometrical properties for making their virtual roads realistic, 
this algorithm has still proven its ability not only in generating road networks precisely but also in testing lane-keeping systems effectively.
%
To elaborate, the algorithm initializes sequences of points and then generates valid road segments, which construct valid road networks.
%
Furthermore, AsFAULT utilizes a search-based approach to evolve their road networks.
%
Besides, the approach encodes road networks as a hierarchical data structure and provides navigation paths, in which driving tasks can conduct and those paths are modeled as a graphic representation.
%
In order to indicate that the AsFAULT is superior in comparison to Random Search, researchers formulated four research questions and concluded empirical studies on two different self-driving software systems such as BeamNG.AI and DeepDriving.
%
With regards to evaluation metrics, they performed Mann-Whitney U-test \textit{p}-values for significance tests and Vargha–Delaney statistics to measure the effective size.
%
As a result, the approach demonstrated its capability by finding the number of \textit{OBE} in both test subjects which are twice as many \textit{OBE} as random search. 
%
It also indicates the difficulty in the evolution of single-road networks in comparison with the multi-road networks as well as illustrates that although small maps can speed up the searching, the large maps can increase effectiveness to test cases.


\section{Critical Discussion}
%1/2 Page
First of all, the paper was well written. In the abstract of the paper, it not only identified problems that the traditional testing framework faced in self-driving cars but also proposed an alternative solution to address those problems successfully. In the same way, the paper provided compelling evidence to support their arguments on why their approach statistically outperformed Random Search in most of the given case studies. 
%
Furthermore, researchers attempted to make their paper approachable to the public by explaining basic concepts such as naturalistic field operational tests, PCG mechanism, and SBST for Lane Keeping in detail. Therefore, it makes those terms comprehensible. 
%
Finally, the goals of the experiment are identified clearly and measured carefully by the authors. To elaborate, the configuration of the approach has been analyzed deeply and the authors also discussed several possible drawbacks such as a large number of possible roads or paths causing high pressure to the software, etc. even if some have already been solved.
%
Also, researchers translated their research into an applicable use through empirical studies on BeamNG.AI and DeepDriving. The results then were measured by evaluation metrics such as Mann-Whitney U-test \textit{p}-values and Vargha–Delaney statistic, so that they are reliable and adequate to justify the hypothesis.

On the other hand, it might be possible that the measures used are not comparable across experiments which are considered as a construct validity threat. Thus, the authors might propose a solution on how to reduce this threat. 
%
Moreover, the paper introduced the DeepDriving extension which adjusts the prediction quality of DeepDriving and if the predictions do not work as expected, the control will switch to BeamNG.AI which might cause a potential bias in the experiment.
%
Last but not least, experiment settings are limited in fixed width and single lane per traffic direction due to its simplification and fast generation for testing. However, it will be better if the AsFAULT can solve the problem with multi-lane per traffic direction in future work since these kind of roads are quite popular around the world.

To conclude, I’m almost convinced that the combination of PCG and SBST is by far an ideal, pragmatic approach for generating the effective road networks, which can recognize many safety-critical problems of the self-driving car.

\section{Rating}
% Add here the overall rating of the paper (1 start is BAD, 5 starts is VERY GOOD). Please explain in one or two sentences the reason of your evaluation and whether you suggests the paper for the next edition of the seminar.
\Stars{5}

The paper has defined many  concepts transparently and illustrated the empirical evaluation carefully with proper research questions and statistical methods. Even though, there are still small problems, they can be solved in future work, so I would rate this paper 5 stars.

Of course I highly recommend this paper for the next semester !
