\section{Summary}
%1/2 Page
The paper discusses the advantages of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) in the testing of autonomous vehicles and an existing critical missing aspect of the autonomous driving testing domain. 
%
Thus, it proposes a systematic physical-world testing approach, namely DeepBillboard to produce an adversarial billboard test, which supposes to work under various driving conditions and cause mis-steering targeted steering model.
%
The proposed approach is to generate a printable billboard image with perturbations that aims to enhance test effectiveness and exploit the influence of digital and physical perturbation generation for autonomous systems' steering decisions.

In this paper, the DeepBillboard focused on driving by roadside billboards when it generates adversarial billboard images along a road that tries to mislead the steering angle or cause off-tracking.
%
In addition, the approach consists of the CNN-based steering models which will be responsible for receiving images captured by multiple sensors as inputs and then generating steering angle decisions as outputs.
%
The authors defined the Joint Loss Optimization algorithm for producing several adversarial perturbations that will result in misleading steering decisions of an autonomous vehicle with various driving conditions.
%
Furthermore, DeepBillboard provided implementations to not only address the overlapped perturbations issues among multiple frames to avoid interferences among those frames but also define Non-printability Score (NPS) to enhance perturbation in the physical world.
%
For different environmental conditions, the paper introduced a color adjustment function that adjusts color differences in the video captured by a dashcam which intends to minimize impacts on the adversarial efﬁcacy.
%
To indicate the effectiveness, the authors evaluate the effectiveness of their algorithm by measuring the Average Angle Errors (AAE) of all frames digitally and physically.
%
As a result, DeepBillboard made all steering models generate an observable average steering angle and the steering angle errors increase as the billboard size increases.
%
Regarding Physical Case Study, the steering angles were straight with the white billboard while it turned to a certain degree with the bright or dark billboard.
%
Moreover, DeepBillboard represented the large Exp\_AAE and Test\_AAE values of test effectiveness under different weather conditions with slight differences between those metrics which supposes to indicate the approach’s effectiveness in the physical world setting.


\section{Critical Discussion}
%1/2 Page
First of all, the paper was well written. In the beginning, it not only identified problems that the traditional scenario generation testing framework faced in the automotive domain but also proposed an alternative solution to address those problems transparently.
%
Furthermore, researchers attempted to make their paper approachable to the public by explaining basic concepts such as the architectural design concept, the prototypical implementation for Predictive Cruise Control, and fine-tuning network parameters, etc. in detail. Therefore, it makes those terms comprehensible, even for people with minimal software testing experience.
%
Additionally, the authors have provided discussion to compare the advantages and disadvantages of their work and other similar studies, so that the audience can notice the differences and derive new insights from the paper's approach.
%
Finally, the goals of the experiment are identified and measured by the authors when the paper provided compelling evidence with proper statistical figures such as Reproduction Errors to support their arguments in most of the given case studies.
%

On the other hand, the proposed approach missed an appropriate baseline model to assert the practical effectiveness. 
%
Due to the lack of the baseline models applied state-of-the-art approaches, it might be easy to introduce bias into the effectiveness and feasibility of the approach.
%
In addition, from a professional standpoint, it is ideally advised to introduce a research goal and research questions, and then demonstrate some experiments to answer how they achieve the goal. 
%
Without a proper research goal and research questions, it is difficult to narrow down the research topic which makes the paper hard to read and understand the research problem and how the authors solve those problems.
%
Furthermore, the number of signals of the prototypical implementation is only two, the former is the upfront vehicle and the latter is the road characteristics.
%
The amount of signals is quite small which might be difficult to validate results of experiments being reliable and adequate to justify the hypothesis.
%
To conclude, I’m almost convinced that using the proposed approach to not only generate critical scenarios for stress-testing the self-driving cars but also save the computational cost is by far an ideal, pragmatic approach for exposing many safety-critical problems and this approach might be sufficient to translate this concept into applicable use.

\section{Rating}
% Add here the overall rating of the paper (1 start is BAD, 5 starts is VERY GOOD). Please explain in one or two sentences the reason of your evaluation and whether you suggests the paper for the next edition of the seminar.
\Stars{4}

The paper has defined concepts transparently and illustrated the empirical evaluation carefully with proper arguments and statistical methods. Even though, there are still major problems, they can be solved in future work, so I would rate this paper 4 stars.

Of course I highly recommend this paper for the next semester !
