\section{Summary}
%1/2 Page
The paper discusses the testing challenges of autonomous vehicles in naturalistic field operational tests since such testings are impractical and dangerous. 
%
This calls for simulation testing of self-driving software which demands to generate critical driving scenarios. 
%
Those techniques require numerous sensory data which are scarce to collect so that it prevents a full reproduction.
%
And thus, the authors propose a testing generation framework called AC3R, aimed to generate critical scenarios for stress-testing self-driving software in diverse ways.
%
The approach extracts information from police reports and attempt to reproduce critical driving scenarios encountered in the real-world, and generate crashes as sustainable test cases in a simulation environment.
%

The proposed technique AC3R consists of a four-step approach to analyze the police documents and acquire simulation-based test cases such as information extraction, trajectory planning, simulation generation, and test generation.
%
Specifically, the AC3R utilizes the NLP and the domain-specific ontology to extract information about roads and vehicles involved in accidents.
%
The intercepting trajectories were computed afterward as an abstract representation including the geometrical data and several waypoints which helps AC3R simulates a car crash using BeamNG.research.
%
Consequently, the simulation output will be accumulated with test oracles to derive system-level test cases.
%
To indicate that the AC3R is not only effectively producing simulations matching police reports and efficiently in the practical applicability, but also can derive suitable test scenarios, researchers validated their research by addressing five research questions and concluding empirical studies on two different self-driving software systems such as BeamNG.AI and DeepDriving.
%
As a result, the AC3R produced nearly 58\% considered simulations of the impact according to police reports and those simulations were supposed to accurately reflect the police reports' description by a standard online survey service involving 34 participants. 
%
Also, the practical applicability of the AC3R is provable at analyzing police reports and producing corresponding critical scenarios.
%
Last but not least, the critical test cases produced by AC3R were successfully driving DeepDriving’s driver controller in different ways than the corresponding non-critical test cases and they are effectively exposed safety-critical problems of the self-driving car software.

\section{Critical Discussion}
%1/2 Page
First of all, the paper was well written. In the abstract of the paper, it not only identified problems that the traditional testing framework faced in self-driving cars but also proposed an alternative solution to address those problems successfully. 
%
Furthermore, researchers attempted to make their paper approachable to the public by explaining the framework' mechanisms such as information extraction, trajectory planning, simulation generation, and test generation in detail. Therefore, it makes those terms comprehensible. 
%
Finally, the goals of the experiment are identified and validated carefully by the authors. 
%
In the same way, researchers attempted to make their paper persuasive since they provided compelling evidence to support their arguments on why AC3R is efficiently generating critical test cases by providing extensive evaluation, an online survey involving 34 participants, and testing with a state-of-art self-driving software such as DeepDriving and BeamNG.AI.
%
The configuration of those empirical studies has been analyzed deeply and the authors also discussed several observations and possible reasons behind.
%
Also, researchers translated their research into an applicable use through empirical studies. The results then were evaluated and elaborated by corresponding bar charts so that they are reliable and adequate to justify the hypothesis.

On the other hand, it is ideally advised to introduce statistical significance to measure the final result.
%
The authors could consider adding a statistical significance such as $p$-value to evaluate and measure the certainty of the results to increase their final conclusion's reliability.
%
Another point that is worth considering might be the lack of discussion about other crash contributing factors such as weather or traffic elements.
%
It would be better if the authors can provide some arguments on how effective AC3R is at producing simulations with the simulated environment or traffic elements.
%
Last but not least, experiment settings are limited in police reports on a fixed size map.
%
However, it will be better if AC3R could extend its ability to new types of reports in order to formulate numerous critical test cases in the future.
%
To conclude, I’m almost convinced that the AC3R is by far an ideal, pragmatic approach for generating the effective driving adversarial scenarios, which can expose many safety-critical problems of the self-driving software and the proposed approach might be sufficient to translate this concept into applicable use.

\newpage 
% Paper rating, critical questions and related work sections must always appear on the second page of the summary

\section{Rating}
% Add here the overall rating of the paper (1 start is BAD, 5 starts is VERY GOOD). Please explain in one or two sentences the reason of your evaluation and whether you suggests the paper for the next edition of the seminar.
\Stars{5}

The paper has represented its concept transparently and illustrated its empirical evaluation with proper configurations as well. The evaluation results have been promising to expose weaknesses of self-driving softwares. Although there are still small trivial problems, the general approach is comprehensible and those problems can be solved in future work, so I would rate this paper 5 stars.

Of course I would highly recommend this paper for the next semester!
