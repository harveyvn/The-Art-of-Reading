\section{Summary}
%1/2 Page
The paper discusses the testing challenges of autonomous vehicles with human involvement and specification since such testing settings not only suppose to be time-consuming and difficult in scaling but also create the potential absence of critical driving scenarios.
%
Therefore, the authors introduced a method to automate the process of generating adversarial scenarios by using the Bayesian Optimization technique to find dangerous adversarial scenarios which suppose to expose weakness of self-driving policies and improve the safety of its software.
%

The proposed approach consists of a searching process that relied on Bayesian Optimization (BO), a robust simulator imitation learning, and hierarchical policy representation.
%
To elaborate, the BO is a method for discovering the global optima of a black-box function, the imitation learning technique is an algorithm for fine-tuning the self-driving hyper-parameters to derive safer driving behavior and the a hierarchical policy representation performs an optimization for data-efficient in purpose.
%
In this paper, the black-box function is the cumulative cost-to-go function which has been using the Gaussian Process to perform exploration in high uncertainty areas.
%
The approach aims to optimize the behaviors of Non-Player Characters (NPC)
%
and determine a parameter identification of adversarial policies and trajectories which assists to define the high-risk adversarial configurations for the self-driving policy. 
% 
To indicate that the approach is superior in comparison to baselines including the Random Search and the Cross-Entropy Method, researchers executed their proposed method on three case scenarios that respectively involve a pedestrian, a vehicle, and both of them.
%
Also, the number of crashes and their proportions are recorded to compare an effectiveness in generating higher crashes between those methods and
%
the imitation learning algorithm has been used to retrain the policy to validate its capability of increasing the safety of driving policy.
%
As a result, when the performance of the BO approach exceeded two baselines in two case scenarios, the BO method demonstrated its performance in producing crashes with higher impact, overtaking other methods by 1.4 times and a cooperation between the imitation learning and a domain expert leads to a successful retraining to avoid vehicle crashes and increase safety of self-driving cars.


%The approach consists of a robotic simulator named $Mana$ and virtual worlds generated by the Procedural Content Generation (PCG) algorithm. 
%%
%The researchers collected relevant environmental attributes and robotic characteristics to build a world model for a simulation environment.
%%
%Regarding data collection and analysis, researchers gathered the navigation tracking's data and data sources come from the point of view of the robot and the external observer respectively.
%%
%Each simulation run is sorted as a binomial classification task depending on the successful and failed state of the test.
%%
%To evaluate the practical effectiveness, researchers validated the research by addressing three research questions.
%%
%The first question debates an influence that control parameters have on the levels of difficulty (easy, challenging, and very difficult configuration).
%%%%
%%%The next question examines which control parameters impact the level of indeterminism while the final is to compare the evolution of the fault navigation service among different levels of difficulties.
%%%%
%%%As a result, there is an obvious correlation between the control parameters and levels of difficulty when the deformation $d$ increases, it indicates the general trend of the rising of difficult level.
%%%
%%In addition, due to many small obstacles, a large number of obstacles, and the bigger number of subdivisions of the ground surface, the level of difficulty also notices an increase.
%%
%Furthermore, researchers argue that any control parameters can affect to the evolution of diverse trajectories, not only the difficulty level as expected.
%
%And finally, both the challenging and very difficult configuration reflect a higher revealing power than the easy configuration with respect to a faulty version of the navigation.



\section{Critical Discussion}
%1/2 Page
First of all, the paper was well written. In the beginning, it not only identified problems that the traditional testing framework faced in unstructured and human shared environments but also proposed an alternative solution to address those problems transparently.
%
Furthermore, researchers attempted to make their paper approachable to the public by explaining basic concepts such as measurements to classify the difficulty, macroscopic parameters for map generation, class of experiment, etc. in detail. Therefore, it makes those terms comprehensible, even for people with minimal software testing experience.  
%
Finally, the goals of the experiment are identified and measured by the authors when the paper provided compelling evidence with statistical figures to support their arguments in most of the given case studies.
%

On the other hand, the proposed approach missed its applicable usage to assert the practical effectiveness. 
%
Due to lack of the examples applied state-of-the-art approaches, it might be easy to introduce bias into its effectiveness and feasibility for testing robot navigation.
%
Another point is the reproducibility problem due to the absence of controlling parameters' information such as the number of obstacles, the obstacle size, and the number of subdivisions.
%
In order to address this problem, the authors might consider the settings suggested by the guide provided by other similar papers or they can add the default settings to their paper.
%
Regarding conclusion validity threats, the authors failed to mention some evaluation metrics such as Mann-Whitney U-test $p$-values to measure and evaluate final results, so that their conclusion could be less reliable and adequate to justify the hypothesis.
%
Besides, the configuration setting is limited in identifying which factor that affects to indeterminism, so that a given explanation to the second research question might be insufficient.
%
Therefore, this paper might be deficient to provide new insights toward the indeterminism and its evolution of the navigation in different levels of difficulties.
%
Last but not least, the experiment settings have restricted the world model to static elements due to their simplification. 
%
However, it will be better if the authors can solve the problem with dynamic elements in future work since these kinds of testing are quite popular and have attractted interest from the testing community.
%
To conclude, Iâ€™m interested in the idea of controlling the level of difficulty is by far an ideal, pragmatic approach for generating effective critical test cases to expose problems of the self-driving car but the proposed approach might be insufficient to translate this concept into applicable use.

\section{Rating}
% Add here the overall rating of the paper (1 start is BAD, 5 starts is VERY GOOD). Please explain in one or two sentences the reason of your evaluation and whether you suggests the paper for the next edition of the seminar.
\Stars{3}

The paper has defined concepts and experimental design transparently. However, there are still significant problems as mentioned above, so I would rate this paper 3 stars.

Of course, I do not recommend this paper for the next semester!
