\section{Summary}
%1/2 Page
The paper discusses the testing challenges of autonomous vehicles in the reality due to low performance and high danger which can cause fatal accidents. 
Despite computer intensive, virtual testing is considered as an alternative environment. Thus the authors propose a search-based procedural content generation approach to address these challenges. 
%
The paper introduced the procedural content generation (PCG) as an algorithm to create a game content and the search-based testing (SBST) as an algorithm to generate test cases in the self-driving car context and 
by combining two algorithms into one approach, it will be able to produce efficient case studies for exposing problems of self-driving car software systems.
%
In spite of the fact that virtual road generation by PCG is challenging due to complexities in geometrical properties for making their virtual roads closing to realities, 
this algorithm has still proven its potential ability to generate virtual road networks precisely and effectively.
%
To elaborate, the algorithm initializes virtual road as sequences of points (polylines) for simplifying not only the rendering operation but also evaluation of geometric properties.
%
Furthermore, road generation mechanism only generates valid road segments, which are not self-intersect and they do not cross the map boundary either. 
In addition, the front line of the former road segment will be the back line of the latter in order to ensure the gapless condition.
%
All of them contributes to construct valid road networks, where one valid road intersects to at least one road at the starting point IP of both roads.
%
A search-based approach to improve the network with an aim of making the autonomous cars to deviate from the road.
%
Finally, they evaluate their model on two self-driving car software systems and explored that AsFault does not only have a better performance in speed but also improve a test suite generation when it can catch up to twice as many as lane deviation in comparison with other random testing (...).
