\section{Summary}
%1/2 Page
The paper proposes a set of safety contracts for self-driving software and presents some semantics of Signal Temporal Logic to demonstrate the improvement of the autonomous control software's safety performance.
%
This calls for utilizing STL which expresses those safety contracts in a lightweight specification language and enables a wide range of Verification \& Validation (V\&V) methodologies.
%
Those methodologies include test case generation, falsification, formal verification, and runtime monitoring which can be intercorporate into the automotive development process.
%
Due to several proposed advantages over other similar works such as the improvement of the lateral contracts to avoid problematic situations, the support for both discrete and continuous reasoning, and the provision of input-output contracts that allows for safety testing, the authors argue that if all traffic participants stick to those rules, they will be able to avoid crashes.
%

The STL formulas are interpreted over the predicate $f(s) < c$, logical operators ($\neg$, $\lor$, $\land$) and temporal operators.
%
A timed trace $s$ is a time-series data structure which is provided to evaluate STL formulas.
%
Each time trace includes an ordered sequence of states and their associated time which can be used to derive a robustness degree and a robustness trace respectively to describe the robustness value of each timed trace subsequence.
%
To indicate that a set of contracts for autonomous control software is the superior candidate for improving the safety of autonomous vehicles, the authors provided some scenarios along with formal STL and methods.
%
For instance, to prevent crashes between two vehicles, the paper proposed pairwise lateral contracts to calculate the safe lateral distance between those vehicles.
%
Also, when the vehicles move within an unstructured environment, the acceleration funnel consists of a set of positions and then derive longitudinal distance and the lateral distance for any pair of vehicles.
%
Besides, when a vehicle moves through an intersection, the reachable states can be derived from a braking maneuver and zero lateral acceleration.
%
Last but not least, the paper considered two important factors during the development of the autonomy software which means safety requirements should not be restrictive and the following distance between traffic participants should be maintained within reasonable values.

\section{Critical Discussion}
%1/2 Page
First of all, the paper was well written. In the beginning, it not only identified the importance that the autonomous vehicles should have developed industry-wide speciﬁcations but also proposed a solution to address those problems transparently.
%
Furthermore, researchers attempted to make their paper approachable to the public by explaining basic concepts such as signal temporal logic, the semantics of the operators of STL, some implementation of those operators, etc. in detail. 
%
Therefore, it makes those terms comprehensible and accessible, even for people with minimal software testing experience.
%
Additionally, the authors have provided an interesting discussion to compare the advantages and disadvantages of their work and other similar studies, so that the audience can notice the differences and derive new insights from the paper's approach.
%
Finally, the goals of the experiment are identified and measured by the authors when the paper provided compelling evidence with proper statistical figures to support their arguments in most of the given case studies.
%

On the other hand, the proposed approach missed its applicable usage to assert the practical effectiveness. 
%
Due to the lack of the examples applied state-of-the-art approaches, it might be easy to introduce bias into the effectiveness and feasibility of those safety contracts.
%
In addition, from a professional standpoint, it is ideally advised to introduce a research goal and research questions, and then demonstrate some experiments to answer how they achieve the goal. 
%
Without a proper research goal and research questions, it is difficult to narrow down the research topic which makes the paper hard to read and understand the research problem and how the authors solve those problems.
%
Another point that is worth considering might be the missing statistical significance to measure the statistical result.
%
The authors could consider adding a statistical significance such as $p$-value to evaluate and measure the certainty of the results so that their final conclusion could be more reliable and adequate to justify the hypothesis.
%
Besides, the authors not only failed to elaborate several STL formulas such as how they are formulated and how they contribute to a set of contracts but also missed solutions for two factors that affect developing safety requirements.
%
To conclude, I’m interested in the idea of providing a suitable set of contracts for autonomous control software is by far an ideal, pragmatic approach for avoiding collisions but the proposed approach might be insufficient to translate this concept into applicable use.

\section{Rating}
% Add here the overall rating of the paper (1 start is BAD, 5 starts is VERY GOOD). Please explain in one or two sentences the reason of your evaluation and whether you suggests the paper for the next edition of the seminar.
\Stars{3}

The paper has defined concepts and experimental design transparently. However, there are still significant problems as mentioned above, so I would rate this paper 3 stars.

Of course, I do not recommend this paper for the next semester!
