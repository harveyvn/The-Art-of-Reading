\section{Summary}
%1/2 Page
The paper discusses the testing challenges of autonomous vehicles in unstructured and human shared environments since such testing settings exposes the low performance and mission achievement issues. 
%
Despite compute-intensive tasks, simulation-based testing is still in use as an alternative to the aforementioned approach because it avoids catastrophic accidents, explores different number of situations and controls input and output analysis.
%
And thus, the authors proposed a testing framework based on MORSE (Modular Open Robots Simulation Engine) to provide a new perspective toward future testing environments to stress the navigation service.
%

The approach consists of the use of a robotic simulator named $Mana$ and virtual worlds generated by Procedural Content Generation (PCG) algorithm. 
%
The researchers collected relevant environmental attributes and robotic characteristics to build a world model for navigation scenarios.
%
Then, Blender functions and predefined objects instantiates the world model as a simulation environment.
%
Regarding data collection and analysis, researchers gathered data which is relevant to the navigation tracking and data sources come from the point of view of the robot and the external observer respectively.
%
Each simulation run is sorted as a binomial classification task depending on the successful or failed state of the test.
%
To evaluate the practical effectiveness, researchers validated the research by addressing three research questions.
%
The first question debates an influence that control parameters have on level of difficulties (easy, challenging, and very difficult configuration).
%
The next question examines which control parameters impact the level of indeterminism while the final is to compare the evolution of the fault navigation service among different level of difficulties.
%
As a result, there is an obvious connection between the control parameters and levels of difficulty when the deformation $d$ increases, it indicates the general trend of the rising of difficult level.
%
Because of many small obstacles, the large number of obstacles and the bigger number of subdivisions of the ground surface, the level of difficulty also notices an increase.
%
Furthermore, researchers argue that any control parameters can affect to the evolution of diverse trajectories, not only the difficulty level as expected.
%
And finally, both the challenging and very difficult configuration reflect a higher revealing power than the easy configuration with respect to a faulty version of navigation.



\section{Critical Discussion}
%1/2 Page
First of all, the paper was well written. In the beginning, it not only identified problems that the traditional testing framework faced in unstructured and human shared environments but also proposed an alternative solution to address those problems successfully.
%
Furthermore, researchers attempted to make their paper approachable to the public by explaining basic concepts such as measurements to classify the difficulty, macroscopic parameters for map generation, class of experiment, etc. in detail. Therefore, it makes those terms comprehensible, even for people with minimal software testing experience.  
%
Finally, the goals of the experiment are identified and measured by the authors when the paper provided compelling evidence with statistical figures to support their arguments in most of the given case studies.
%

On the other hand, the proposed approach missed baseline models to assert its practical effectiveness. 
%
Due to the lack of the comparison with other state-of-the-art approaches, it might be easy to introduce bias into its effectiveness and feasibility for testing robot navigation.
%
Another point is the reproducibility problem due to the absence of controlling parameters' information such as the number of obstacles, the obstacle size, and the number of subdivisions.
%
In order to address this problem, the authors might consider the settings suggested by the guide provided by other similar papers or add the default settings to their paper.
%
Regarding conclusion validity threats, the authors missed using evaluation metrics such as Mann-Whitney U-test $p$-values to measure and evaluate final results, so that their conclusion could be less reliable and adequate to justify the hypothesis.
%
Besides, the configuration setting is limited in identifying which factor that affects to indeterminism, so that a given explanation to the second research question might be insufficient.
%
Therefore, this paper could fail to provide new insights toward the indeterminism and its evolution of the navigation.
%
Last but not least, the experiment settings have restricted the world model to static elements due to its simplification. 
%
To conclude, Iâ€™m interested in the idea of controlling the level of difficulty by the use of the generation parameters is by far an ideal, pragmatic approach for generating effective critical test cases to expose problems of the self-driving car but it might be insufficient to translate this concept into applicable use.

\section{Rating}
% Add here the overall rating of the paper (1 start is BAD, 5 starts is VERY GOOD). Please explain in one or two sentences the reason of your evaluation and whether you suggests the paper for the next edition of the seminar.
\Stars{3}

The paper has defined concepts and experimental design transparently. However, there are still significant problems as mentioned above, so I would rate this paper 3 stars.

Of course I donot recommend this paper for the next semester !
