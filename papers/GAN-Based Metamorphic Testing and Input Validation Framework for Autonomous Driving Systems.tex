\section{Summary}
%1/2 Page
The paper discusses the testing challenges of the current DNN-based testing approaches since such testing settings can cause fatal accidents but also have low accuracy in disclosing the inconsistent behaviors of multiple DNN systems in the real-world driving scenarios.
%
And thus, the paper proposes an unsupervised DNN-based framework, namely DeepRoad, to address these problems in autonomous driving systems.
%
DeepRoad consists of an ability to synthesize large amounts of driving scenarios and generate a corresponding adversarial scenario, a metamorphic testing technique for consistency testing, and an effective validation method on input image for such systems.
%

DeepRoad's metamorphic testing module relies on the UNIT DNN-based method to detect the system vulnerability by test cases and then it defines suitable Metamorphic Relations to expose the inconsistent driving behaviors during driving scenes with different weather conditions.
%
Thanks to the metamorphic testing module, DeepRoad can guarantee the accuracy and reliability of autonomous driving systems under different scenarios such as heavy snow or hard rain.
%
Another important module of DeepRoad is an input validation which aims to ensure properly formed data being accepted by systems by comparing the differences between inputs and corresponding training outputs with the proper threshold.
%
The module uses a pre-trained DNN model–VGGNet to extract features from both inputs and training outputs, and then the PCA will reduce their dimension and the average distance will be measured based on image similarity.
%
To indicate the effectiveness of DeepRoad, the authors selected heavy snow and hard rain as weather conditions to collect appropriate images for stress-testing three open-source DNN-based autonomous driving systems from Udacity.
%
Regarding evaluation metrics, they defined metrics to evaluate model inconsistency and input validation.
%
As a result, DeepRoad$_{MT}$ was exposing thousands of inconsistent behaviors under different weather conditions for Autumn, Chauffeur, and Rwightman, respectively.
%
Furthermore, DeepRoad$_{IV}$ was validating inputs effectively by measuring proper threshold which can improve the reliability for the DNN-based autonomous driving system.


\section{Critical Discussion}
%1/2 Page
First of all, the paper was well written. In the beginning, it not only identified problems that the DNN testing framework faced in the automotive domain but also proposed an alternative solution to address those problems comprehensively.
%
Furthermore, researchers attempted to make their paper approachable to the public by explaining proposed concepts such as the structure of UNIT, PAC Learning theory, Framework DeepRoad$_{MT}$, and Framework DeepRoad$_{IV}$ in detail. 
%
Therefore, it makes those terms comprehensible, even for people with minimal software testing experience.
%
Finally, the empirical studies' results have been validated carefully by the authors.
%
The authors have not only explained evaluation metrics relating to DeepRoad$_{MT}$ and DeepRoad$_{IV}$ but also provided a full explanation about experiments' baseline dataset and evaluation models from Udacity including Autumn, Chauffeur, and Rwightman.
%
Moreover, the results of the DeepRoad framework's empirical evaluations have been discussed in detail and the authors also provided compelling evidence with proper statistical figures to support their arguments in most of the given case studies.
%

On the other hand, the introduction of statistical significance such as $p$-value to measure the certainty of the results should have been included to increase the conclusion's reliability and it is ideally advised to introduce a research goal and research questions to narrow down the research topic which makes the paper's research problems and their proposed solutions comprehensible.
%
Moreover, the explanations of sophisticated terminologies were, to a certain extent, distracting; thereby unintentionally shifting readers' attention elsewhere.
%
Additionally, while the proposed approach included variables previously untested, such as altering atmospheric conditions, there might be tolerances between these virtual test cases and real-world driving scenarios since there are no metrics to measure those distances and the authors failed to mention this aspect.
%
Last but not least, experiment settings are limited in the discussion about the influence of a threshold and how to define that threshold.
%
It would be better if the paper can provide scientific methods, whereby the threshold for DeepRoad$_{IV}$ framework is measured.
%
To conclude, I’m almost convinced that the DeepRoad is by far an ideal, pragmatic approach to generating effective driving adversarial scenarios, which can expose inconsistent behaviors of autonomous driving systems in different weather conditions and the proposed approach might be sufficient to translate this concept into applicable use.

\section{Rating}
% Add here the overall rating of the paper (1 start is BAD, 5 starts is VERY GOOD). Please explain in one or two sentences the reason of your evaluation and whether you suggests the paper for the next edition of the seminar.
\Stars{5}

The paper has defined concepts transparently and illustrated the empirical evaluation carefully with proper arguments and statistical methods. Even though, there are still minor problems, they can be solved in future works, so I would rate this paper 5 stars.

Of course I highly recommend this paper for the next semester !
